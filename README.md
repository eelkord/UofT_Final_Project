# UofT_Final_Project

## Problem Definition:
Credit/Loan underwriting is a tedious process involving analysing various aspects/features of the borrower manually. The process is lengthy, time-consuming and prone to human error thereby resulting in defaults and losses for the financial institution. 
The machine learning model can be used in Automating Credit Decisions thereby reducing loan officersâ€™ data input burden with less time spent on each loan application and lower risk of human error. Machine learning provides a faster, accurate and cost-effective solution to the credit underwriting approvals that can result in minimizing defaults and losses for the financial institutions.

## Objective
Objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can automate the loan approval process. 

Objective of the model is to predict if the loan application can be approved basis the multiple inputs including Age, Gender, Income, Education and Number of dependents, Self Employed (complete list below) to predict the output Loan_Status which is approved or not.
